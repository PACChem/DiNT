I. Templates

Templates should be in the directory where the job is running.

I.A. For NP(i) = 1 (G03)

(1) Test.FChk is read to obtain the energies and derivatives. 
(2) Required flags in the input template are: FORCE FCHK NOSYM UNITS=BOHR
(3) GEOMETRY must appear immediately following the charge and multiplicity line. 
    This string will be replaced with the geometry of interest.
(4) Gaussian is picky about blank lines, so be careful.
(5) This option can treat only a single electronic state per template.
(6) Sample template (7 lines):
%mem=4000000
# mp2/6-31g* force fchk NoSym Units=bohr scf=(tight,xqc)

Title

0 2
GEOMETRY

I.B. For NP(i) = 2 (Molpro 2006)

(1) The standard output is parsed to obtain energies and gradients.
(2) geomtyp must be set to xyz (Cartesian).
(3) nosym & noorient are optional.
(4) The GEOMETRY string must appear next in the template. This string 
    will be replaced by: a line containing the # of atoms, a generic 
    title line, and lines specifying the Cartesian coordinates at the 
    geometry of interest.
(5) A line containing the word "end" must appear next.
(6) The input file must contain a line setting the desired energy to 
    the variable "molpro_energy".
(7) Derivatives must immediately follow, via Molpro's "force" keyword.
(8) The program will look for a line containing "GRADIENT FOR STATE" 
    in the standard output to read gradients.
(9) For multiple state calls, do both energies and gradients for a
    state before moving on to the next state.
(10) Sample two-state template (24 lines):
***,title
print,orbitals,civector
memory,200,m

geomtyp=xyz
geometry
nosym
noorient
GEOMETRY

II. Executables

The code uses executables placed in the directory where the job is running
to execute the quantum chemistry calculations. Two are needed. They are:

g.x 	G03 job. The entire contents of this file are (5 lines):
#!/bin/csh
if (-e Test.FChk) then
mv -f Test.FChk Test.FChk_1
endif
g03 < qc.in > qc.out

m.x	Molpro 2006 job. The entire contents of this file are (1 line):
molpro -o qc.out -s qc.in

III. Subroutines
The main file dd.f contains several subroutines:
pot.f	Main POT call
	There is a few lines near the top that should be edited to control 
	which quantum chemistry codes are called.
		NC = number of separate QC calls per geom
		NP(i) = QC package to be used for call #i
		      = 1 for G03.
		      = 2 for Molpro 2006.
		NS(i)= number of states for call #i. Must be set to 1 for a 
				G03 call, i.e., if NP(i)=1. For NP(i)=2 (molpro)
				simply include multiple energy and gradient
				calculations in the same input template. Be sure
				to compute the energy AND forces for a
				state before moving on to the next state.
		TNAME(i) = string (max 10 characters) containing the name of the
				template file for call #i.
		The interface is HE-MM-1 (potflag=3).
		subroutine pot(symb,x,y,z,pemd,gpemd,nat,mnat,nsurf,mnsurf)

cfloat.f	FORTRAN utility taken from polyrate that converts a string to a number.

dd_g03.f	Handles G03 calls. Only one surface may be computed per call.

dd_mo6.f	Handles Molpro2006 calls. One more more surfaces may be computed per call.
		Surfaces are assumed to be diabatic. Diabatic coupling is hard coded.

IV. Future improvements
(1) Read NA coupling from Molpro.
